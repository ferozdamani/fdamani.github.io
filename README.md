# React Project

Movies/Cheap Flights Project, its still a work in progress  

## Work with the App

If you would like to play around with the Webapp:   

* Fork the [App Repo]: (https://github.com/ferozdamani/react_project.git)

In the root folder:

* run ```npm install``` - Install all npm dependencies

* run ```npx webpack``` for a one time build of the app. I recommend using ```npm run watch``` for hot reloads support provided by webpack

* run ```npm run start``` in a seperate terminal to start the server

note: Currently, starting the server opens the default web browser tab on port:2000 with the app running.
You can always edit the dev-server config and [start the app]: (http://localhost:2000)
